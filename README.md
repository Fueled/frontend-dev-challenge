## Premise

For some time the Design Team at [Fueled](https://fueled.com) have had a fortnightly Design Challenge, whereby a loose brief is given to each member of the team and a two hour window in which to create something fitting. As the frontend team has grown at Fueled, it felt like the right time to start doing something similar… and so was born the Frontend Dev Challenge.

It follows the same format: a loose brief is given to the team on a Friday (with the briefs being decided by any of the team with a suitable idea), between Monday and Wednesday we build our solutions, and then on our weekly team call we each present our submission providing rationale and opening up a discussion – typically people talk about the bits they enjoyed, found tricky, and areas they’d have further elaborated on if they’d had the time.

If this sounds like the sort of thing you’d relish doing and you think you’d be a good fit for the Frontend team at Fueled, then get in touch, [we’re hiring](https://fueled.com/jobs)!
